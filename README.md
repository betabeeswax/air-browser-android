# AIR Browser for Android

Native Android browser built with Kotlin and Android WebView.

## First version

- Multiple browser tabs
- Address and search bar
- Back, forward, reload and home
- Bookmarks and browsing history
- Android Download Manager integration
- Dark AIR-style mobile interface
- Session tab restoration

## Build

Open this repository folder in Android Studio, or use a recent Gradle installation with JDK 17:

```sh
gradle :app:assembleDebug
```

The debug APK is created at:

`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

The GitHub Actions workflow builds an APK and publishes it in the GitHub Releases tab. Debug builds are for testing and are not signed for Play Store distribution.

## Privacy

The app uses Android WebView and Android's Download Manager. Bookmarks, history and open-tab URLs are stored locally in app preferences. This first version does not upload browsing history, passwords or cookies to AIR servers. Passwords are not collected by a custom AIR password database in this initial build.
